		<h1>My First D&amp;D Adventure</h1>
		<p>Hello friend!</p>

		<p>
		If you're here, that means you're about to get into your first Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) adventure.
		How exciting! This page will point you at all the things you'll need to prepare for your first session.
		If you have questions about anything that's on here, get in touch with your Dungeon Master (DM).

		<p>
		Before you do anything else, you should go read
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/introduction">the D&amp;D introduction</a>.
		It gives you an idea of how the game is going to go in broad strokes, and how gameplay will work
		mechanically at a high level. I can also highly recommend "<a href="https://www.naddpod.com/">Not
		Another D&amp;& Podcast</a>", which is both entertaining and a great introduction to what playing
		D&amp;D is like. On this page I'll link to <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&amp;D Beyond</a> a
		lot, but all the rules linked on this page are available elsewhere online, and in the
		<a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/rpg_playershandbook">Player's Handbook</a>.

		<p>
		You will be playing one of the official D&amp;D campaigns set in the world of the <em>Forgotten
		Realms</em>, and specifically one that is aimed at introducing new players to the world of D&amp;D. At
		this point, you know next to nothing about that world beyond tales you may have heard from far-away lands,
		and that's okay! Over the course of this adventure (and the ones that follow), you (and your character)
		will slowly uncover the secrets of the world, and the dangers that lurk within.

		<p>
		In D&amp;D, you can create
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters">your very own character</a>,
		but since this is an introductory campaign, your DM has already created a selection of characters for
		you. You should pick one of these, and then let your DM know which one you chose. These characters
		already have a partial backstory, though you can flesh that out together with your DM if you wish.

		<p>The possible characters are:
		<ul>
			<li>A
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Noble">Noble</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/races#Human">Human</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Fighter">Fighter</a>
			<li>A
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/races#Dwarf">Hill Dwarf</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Cleric">Cleric</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Soldier">Soldier</a>
			<li>A
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Criminal">Criminal</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/races#Halfling">Lightfoot Halfling</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Rogue">Rogue</a>
			<li>A
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Alignment">Chaotic</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/races#Elf">High Elf</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Wizard">Wizard</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Acolyte">Acolyte</a>
			<li>A
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/races#Human">Human</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#FolkHero">Folk Hero</a>
			<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Fighter">Fighter</a>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		Each character has a
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/classes">class</a>,
		a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/races">race</a>,
		and a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Backgrounds">background</a>,
		A character's class dictates much of what that character can do, their race mostly affects what they
		look like, and their background affects what they might know or be good at. Each character also has an
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Alignment">alignment</a>,
		which dictates how they act, though that mostly comes into play when you've played more. For now, you
		should just choose which of the characters above appeal more to you at first glance &mdash; this
		campaign is for you to get to know the game, so there's no need to choose optimally! If you don't have a
		preference, that's fine; just let your DM know and they will pick for you.
		
		<p>
		Once you've chosen, give your character a name and tell your DM. After that, find your 
		<a href="https://media.wizards.com/downloads/dnd/StarterSet_Charactersv2.pdf">character's sheet</a>,
		and read the back of the sheet for your character. That will give some of your character's backstory, as
		well as
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#PersonalCharacteristics">personal characteristics</a>
		like their ideals and flaws. <strong>Don't read the back of the other character sheets!</strong> You'll
		get to know them in due course, and the game is more fun that way.
		

		<p>
		On the front of your character's sheet are all of your character's skills, attributes, and abilities, as
		well as any equipment they're carrying. These will become relevant once we start playing, and you'll be
		interacting with this sheet a lot! Your DM will provide you with a physical copy of it when you first
		sit down to play.

		<p>
		Now that you have a character, it's time to learn the
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules">basic rules of the game</a>.
		You should read at least chapters 8
		(<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring">adventuring</a>) and 9
		(<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat">combat</a>). If your character has
		spells, you should also read chapter 10 
		(<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting">spellcasting</a>). If you
		haven't already, you should also read the specific entries for your chosen race (ch. 2), class (ch. 3),
		alignment and background (ch. 4). Finally, look up any
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment">equipment</a>
		or
		<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells">spells</a>
		you have too so that you know how they work.

		<p>
		You don't need to know any of these rules by heart &mdash; your DM will guide you through them as you
		go. However, it is good to at least give them a skim so you have a rough idea of how gameplay will work,
		and the kinds of things you can do in this game.

		<p>
		When it's about time for your first session, you only really need to bring yourself. Your DM will bring
		extra dice, pencils, and note sheets. Of course, if you have any of these youself, you should feel free
		to use your own!

		<p>
		With that, you're ready to get started!<br />
		Good luck, and have fun!
